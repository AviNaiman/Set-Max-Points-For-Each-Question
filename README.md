# Set-Max-Points
This will set the points for each Quiz Question to Max in a Canvas Graded Quiz

Canvas Graded Quizzes need to have each and every question assigned a grade.  Rather than having to hand enter grades for each and every question, this button automatically assigns the max number of points for each question, thereby letting you simply reduce the number of points awarded, for any question that does not deserve full points.

Additions needed:
1) There should be an option / warning to NOT change the grade for any question whose current score is not '--'.
2) This should be done in Gradebook for ALL students (for a particular quiz).
